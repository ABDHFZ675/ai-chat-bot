# 🤖 AI Chatbot Using Python

## 📌 Project Title
**AI Chatbot Development Using Python and Free Tools or APIs**

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple AI-based chatbot that can interact with users through text, respond intelligently using basic AI or ML logic, and demonstrate core concepts of chatbot development using Python and free/open-source tools.

## 🧠 How It Works
- The user types a message (text input).
- The chatbot processes the input using rule-based or ML-based logic.
- A relevant and meaningful response is generated and displayed back to the user.
- The chatbot can handle at least **5–10 sample queries** intelligently.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - `random`, `nltk`, `re`, or other free libraries (as per your implementation)
  - Optionally: `Flask`, `SpeechRecognition`, `pyttsx3` for bonus features
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (for submission)

## ✅ Features
- Text-based chat interaction
- AI/ML logic for response generation (rule-based or trained model)
- CLI or GUI interface (basic)
- Uses **only free tools and APIs**

### 🔹 Optional (Bonus) Features
- Voice input/output
- Simple web interface
- Chat history display
